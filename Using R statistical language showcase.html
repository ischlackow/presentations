## Talk overview and format

* The purpose of this talk is not to teach R, but to illustrate what it is capable of. Topics covered include:

  + What is R and why do we need RStudio?
  
  + Performing statistical tests in R

  + Writing reproducible reports with R and R Markdown

  + Integration with other software

  + Further capabilities

  + Getting help
  
--
  
* There will be some code, but don't worry if it makes no sense; it's the _logic_ behind it that I was trying to illustrate rather than actual detail.

--

* Q&amp;A session at the end

  + I am very bad at multitasking so unlikely to be able to monitor the chat and talk at the same time!

# What is R and why do we need RStudio?

---

## What is R?
  
&lt;img src="images/Rlogo.png" height="50"&gt; is a programming language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics.

* Created by statisticians .red[R]oss Ihaka and .red[R]obert Gentleman;

* version 1.0 released in 2000;

* current stable release: 4.2.0, released on 22 April 2022;

* has been growing in popularity, ranked 13th in the TIOBE index;

* used in various sectors and across the world;

* users can create and share their own packages to extend functionality.

&lt;br&gt;

## Why R?
  
R is a language designed for statistical analyses. Its benefits include:
  
* free, open-source, runs on most platforms;

* massive online community support;

* numerous data analysis packages, often appear faster than in other software;

* able to read in most database formats;

* superior graphical capabilities;

* ability to automate repetitive tasks;

* great for reproducibility;

* integration with Word, LaTeX; Tableau, Power BI; C++, Python, SQL;

* interactive web applications.

## What is RStudio?
  
* an integrated development environment for R;

* free, open-source, runs on many platforms 

  + commercial editions available;

* user-friendly frontend of R;

* simplifies writing code (indentation, colour-coding, list of loaded objects, predictive typing);

* numerous add-ons: debugging, version control, reproducible reports with R markdown, presentations; 

* can be used for Python.

## Data
  
Dataset `grades` contains student records from a (purely hypothetical) collegiate university:

* 100 students;

* information on Student's ID, Year of matriculation, College, Division, and FPE/FHS grade;

* _First_ defined as having an FHS grade of 70+.


```

# Writing reproducible reports with R and R Markdown

---

## R Markdown

R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R.

* Document is written in plain text format, split into _chunks_.

* Chunks could be normal text, R code, Python code, LaTeX maths equations, CSS styling commands, ...

* Possible to insert images, hyperlinks, tables, table of contents, ...

* To see the output, file (usually) needs to be _knitted._

* Output could be HTML, .pdf, .docx, slideshow.

* Any changes to the code / underlying data will automatically be incorporated at the next knitting.

  + No need to (re-)copy-paste with each data update.

  + Once setup, straightforward to generate reproducible reports.

* Possible to split large files into several smaller ones (e.g. separate chapters of a large report).

---

## Inserting R code into an R Markdown report

R code/output could be inserted in-line or as a separate paragraph. E.g.:

--

_The average FHS grade across the 100 students was 71.6. The distribution of the FHS grades across colleges and divisions is shown below._


```
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
## # Groups:   College [2]
##   College Humanities `Medical Sciences`  MPLS `Social Sciences`
##   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 A             69.6               64.6  76                70.8
## 2 B             71                 72.5  71.4              78.4
```

--

`The average FHS grade across the 'r nrow(grades)' students was 'r round(mean(grades$FHS), digits = 1)'. The distribution of the FHS grades across colleges and divisions is shown below.`


```r
grades %&gt;%
  group_by(College, Division) %&gt;%
  summarise(FHS = round(mean(FHS), digits = 1)) %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = College, names_from = Division, values_from = FHS)
```

---

## Inserting R code into an R Markdown report



Suppose records on further 50 students from College C have been added.

--

_The average FHS grade across the 150 students was 71.3. The distribution of the FHS grades across colleges and divisions is shown below._


```
## # A tibble: 3 x 5

## Graphics (`ggplot2` package)




.red[Let us plot average FHS grades by Year/Division/College.]

--

Dataset `grades_mean` summarises the original `grades` dataset by calculating average FHS grades by Year/Division/College. 


```
## # A tibble: 6 x 4
## # Groups:   College, Division [2]
##   College Division         Year  FHS_mean
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;

## 2 A       Humanities       2011      60  
## 3 A       Humanities       2012      67.3
## 4 A       Medical Sciences 2010      63.8
## 5 A       Medical Sciences 2011      64  
## 6 A       Medical Sciences 2012      65.7
```

---

## `ggplot2` logic

`ggplot2` is a _system_ for declaratively creating graphics.

* Plots are generated by specifying one _layer_ (specification) at a time (e.g. type of graph to be constructed; colours to be used);

* layers are connected by `+`;

* input arguments are columns from a dataset.

First, the dataset to be used is specified:


```r
ggplot(data = grades_mean)
```

---

Add bar chart; plot FHS mean by Division; side-by-side bars for each Year:


```r

           position = position_dodge2(), stat = "identity")
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Stratify by College along the y-axis:


```r

```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Add text labels:


```r
+ geom_text(aes(x = Division, y = FHS_mean - 3, label = round(FHS_mean)), 
            colour = "white", position = position_dodge2(0.9))
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Rename labels (axes, legend):


```r
+ labs(x = "University Division", y = "Average FHS grade", fill = "Year")
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Manually adjust the colours using the RGB palette:


```r
+ scale_fill_manual(values = c("#4CD081", "#E2B54D", "#F2103D"))
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Change to grayscale:


```r
+ scale_fill_grey()
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Remove x-axis ticks:


```r
+ theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Change the font size, angle and colour of the y-axis label:


```r
+ theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 13, angle = 30, colour = "blue"))
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Move the legend to the bottom:


```r
+ theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Tables

Various R packages exist to create tables of publication quality (`flextable` + `officer`; `kable` + `kableExtra`):

* merge cells;

* add header rows and footnotes;

* change font, size, alignment

  + individual cell, row, column or whole table level;

* colour-code cells

  + absolutely (e.g. colour rows 2 to 5) or conditionally (e.g. colour cells containing significant relationships);

* change all/some table borders;

* mix content, text and images;

--

* constructed by specifying _layers,_ just like graphs

  + layers may be connected with `%&gt;%` instead of `+`.

---

## Table example: combining several regression outputs

.red[Which applicant's characteristics (e.g. gender, GCSE achievement) are associated with their on-course outcomes (e.g. FHS grade)?]

--

Multiple linear regressions fitted to look for associations, with the raw output for each regression looking like this...

![](images/regressions_raw.png)
---

... and combined output looking like this:

![](images/regressions_1_pic.png)

--

Automated features:

* estimates presented together with standard errors;

* numbers rounded to a pre-defined number of digits; trailing zero(es);

* asterisks indicate significance of associations (e.g *** = p&lt;0.001);

* significant coefficients colour-coded depending on direction of effect;

* table incorporated into the .docx, no need to copy-paste.
 
---

## Benefits of automation

.red[Suppose we want to add an extra explanatory variable:

* indicator for achieving all GCSE A*s: yes/no.

---

## Integration with Tableau Desktop

* In R: 

  + install R and package `Rserve`;

  + load the package and run `Rserve()` command.

* In Tableau: initialise connection to Rserve

  + manage external service connection.
  
--
  
* In Tableau: create a calculated field -&gt; table calculations

  + Possible table calculations include SCRIPT_BOOL, SCRIPT_INT, SCRIPT_REAL or SCRIPT_STR depending on the (R) function output.  Each calculation contains two arguments. 

  + 1st argument: actual R code in "", lines separated by `;`
  
  + 2nd argument: function arguments, separated by `,`
  
--

* Any R packages used in the code need to be separately installed _in R._

* Test the R code in R before inputting into Tableau.

## Integration with Power BI Desktop

* Install R / Microsoft R Open.

* Power BI Desktop should enable R automatically:

  + to check, go to Options -&gt; Global -&gt; R scripting;
  
  + links with further documentation available at this page.

--

* R script editor available within Power BI Desktop.

* Enabling R visuals will initialise the R script editor.

--

* Complete interaction between R syntax and Power BI Desktop actions:

  + once loaded, data can be modified in Power Query or R;
  
  + any Power BI Desktop action will generate underlying code in the R script editor.
  
--

* Limitations should be noted (e.g. only 150,000 rows of data can be used by an R visual)

## Using other software in R scripts

* Python

  + RStudio accommodates Python scripts

  + Python code can live in R (package `reticulate`)
  
  + R code can live in Python

* SQL (package `RODBC`)

* C++ (packages `Rcpp`, `RcppArmadillo`)
